; First level. This should be very easy, but introduce a few concepts:
; - Basic player movement
; - There are multiple paths to the items
; - Some paths are better than others
; - You can collect multiple items in one move
;
; "Very easy" means:
; - No block movement should be needed for the solution
; - Choices are binary - right or left
; - The level is a series of small independent puzzles, so not much advance
;   planning is needed
; - The items mostly act as breadcrumbs leading you on the correct path,
;   with few real choices presented
